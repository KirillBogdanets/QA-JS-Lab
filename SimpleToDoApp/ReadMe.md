If you want to add new node into the .json file you have to go to the foulder "json_worker" and enter next command in command line: 'node add.js --title="some title" --body="some body"' .
If you need to remove some note by it's title from .json file you need to go to the foulde "json_worker" and enter next command in command line: 'node remove.js --title="some title"' .
If you want to see all notes which are located in .json File you need to enter next command in command line: 'npm run list' .
If you want to read note from .jsonFile by it's title you need to enter next command in command line: 'npm run read "some title"' or 'npm run read some title' .
